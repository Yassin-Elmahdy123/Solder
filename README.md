## Describtion:
# This is my hand made circuit. It consists of two LEDs, two resistors, two push buttons, and a battery holder.
# When the two push buttons are pressed, the two LEDs turn on. When the left push button is pressed, the left LED turns on. However, when the right push button is pressed, no LED turns on.
